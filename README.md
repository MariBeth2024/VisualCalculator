## Introduction
Our Visual Calculator was designed by two teacher-programmers who wanted to create a method for students to visualize the math process that was occuring. The four main operations - add, subtract, multiply, and divide - are represented through the use of animated number lines or dot groupings. This takes calculator use from an abstract tool to something more concrete that reinforces common math models.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Clear and intuitive user interface
- Responsive design for various screen sizes (note: the website has not yet been optimized for use on phones)
